<https://leetcode.com/problems/tree-node/>

```
SELECT
    atree.id,
    IF(ISNULL(atree.p_id),
        'Root',
        IF(atree.id IN (SELECT p_id FROM tree), 'Inner','Leaf')) Type
FROM
    tree atree
;
```

##### Using IF function

<https://leetcode.com/problems/winning-candidate/>
```
SELECT
    name AS 'Name'
FROM
    Candidate
        JOIN
    (SELECT
        Candidateid
    FROM
        Vote
    GROUP BY Candidateid
    ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
    LIMIT 1) AS winner
WHERE
    Candidate.id = winner.Candidateid
;
```
###### Takeaways:
1. Two ways to select from multipule table: 
    using where
    use join
2. use group by and order by, don't need to select count()

    /
    (select count(*) from (select distinct sender_id, send_to_id from friend_request) as B),
    0)
, 2) as accept_rate;
